# OCR-Text-Analysis-API
In this project, we have developed an API that utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and text analysis capabilities to extract text from images. Additionally, we detect sensitive data within the extracted text and perform verification processes. The project incorporates technologies such as FastAPI, Docker Compose, Poetry, and Redis.
